# Discord.py-Bot

This is a Bot designed by myself to try incorporate as many different functions as possible. 
What I mean is I want this bot to be the only bot needed in any given discord server!

## Current Functions
- Channel and Category creation
- Role Management
  - Default Role upon joining server
  - Creates roles
- Join and leave voice channels
- Progress Bar in chat for function progress
  
## W.I.P Functions
- Playing Music in Voice Channels
- Permissions management

## Ideas
I would appreciate if anyone posted in the issues tab possible ideas for functions or for tips on making my code more efficient.
