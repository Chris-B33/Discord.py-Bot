# Discord.py-Bot

This is a Bot designed by myself to try incorporate as many different functions as possible. 

## Current Functions

- Role Management
  - Default Role upon joining server
  - Creates roles
- Join and leave voice channels
- Progress Bar in chat for function progress
  
## W.I.P Functions
- Playing Music in Voice Channels

- Optional Censorship and message management

## Ideas
I would appreciate if anyone posted in the issues tab possible ideas for functions or for tips on making my code more efficient.
